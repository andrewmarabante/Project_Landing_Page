My First CSS Project!

In this project I'm going to be creating a website using CSS to style everything. I have been given a template on The Odin Project that I'm trying to get my website to look like! Here's the template:

Let's get started!

End Of Project:
This was a really good project and I enjoyed it a lot.. Although there were some complications that were pretty frustrating. At some point some stuff happened that wasn't how I wanted it and I had to use git reset. I guess I messed that up and then the branch wasnt up to date and I had to use git pull/merge and it completely deleted my css file.. SO ANNOYING. so after a bit of research I found that adding -f to the git push command will allow me to force the save to the repo and completely overwrite the current. So I rolled back to a good save and did just that.(Although this is not recommended in the future just a last resort for me). So now I'm better at my css AND my git commands. Successful project!
